# **Car Price Prediction Analysis**



## 1. Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a model that can accurately estimate the selling price of cars based on various features such as car brand, mileage, engine size, and more. The analysis also includes data visualization to understand the distribution of car features and their impact on car prices.
## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes various attributes related to car listings. Key columns in the dataset include year, selling_price, km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner, mileage(km/ltr/kg), engine, max_power, and seats. The dataset also contains one-hot encoded columns for categorical features like car brands, fuel types, and transmission types.
## 3. Data Exploration
Data exploration involves understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This includes checking for missing values, visualizing distributions of key variables, and analyzing correlations between features. Insights from data exploration help in identifying trends and relationships that are crucial for feature engineering and model building.
## 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. In this project, feature engineering includes converting string values to numeric, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Additional features such as price_per_mileage and age are created to improve model performance.
## 5. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features. Proper preprocessing ensures that the data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.
## 6. Model Selection and Training
Different machine learning models are evaluated for predicting car prices. In this project, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor are selected. The models are trained on the training dataset and tuned for optimal performance using hyperparameter tuning. Training involves fitting the models to the data and assessing their ability to predict car prices accurately.
## 7. Model Evaluation
Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the trained models using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score. Cross-validation is used to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data. Evaluation helps in comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.
## 8. Data Visualization
Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the dataset and the results of the analysis. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to display the distribution of features and the results of model predictions. Key visualizations include the distribution of car brands, fuel types, transmission types, and price ranges.


## 9. Insights and Findings
Insights and findings summarize the key results from the data analysis and model predictions. This includes identifying the most influential features affecting car prices, understanding the distribution of car brands, and evaluating the performance of the predictive models. Insights provide valuable information for stakeholders and can guide decision-making processes.


## 10. Future Work
Future work involves extending the current analysis and improving the predictive model. This may include incorporating additional features, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, and performing deeper data analysis. Future work aims to enhance the accuracy of predictions and provide more detailed insights into car price trends.
